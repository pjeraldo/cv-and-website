## About me
<img class="right" src="{relocatable: images/patricio.jpg}" alt="Patricio Jeraldo" />

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Institute for Genomic Biology][igb] at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign][uiuc], working jointly as a Research Fellow in the Department of Surgery at [Mayo Clinic][mayo] as part of the [Mayo-Illinois Alliance for Technology-Based Healthcare.][alliance]

My current interests are related to the microbiome of human subjects, as well as related methodologies such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, with a focus on clinical research. The goal is better understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and healthy or disease states, and, I hope, light the way to novel diagnostic and treatment options. As part of this effort, I am also continuing development of a pipeline for processing 16S rRNA reads from next-generation sequencing platforms ([current version is TORNADO version 1.0, available for use][tornado]).

My work is supervised by [Nicholas Chia][chia] at Mayo Clinic.

I am a graduate student working in questions regarding evolution in gut microbiomes, designing a [pipeline for short reads of 16S rRNA][tornado] coming from 454 pyrosequencers accounting for the known artifacts of said sequences, and analyzing and quantifying information loss in phylogenetic trees created using short reads of 16S rRNA.

I am interested in turbulent [superfluid dynamics][sf]: coupling with excitations, long-range, long-wavelength dynamics, efficient coarse-gained numerical algorithms for fully coupled two-fluid dynamics. I also interested in using these numerical techniques in studying the statistics of large fluctuations present in the dynamics of quantum vortices, crystal dislocations, and topological defects in general.

My work is advised by Professor [Nigel Goldenfeld][nigel]. More information about the research interests of the group members can be found through the [groupâ€™s website][group].
